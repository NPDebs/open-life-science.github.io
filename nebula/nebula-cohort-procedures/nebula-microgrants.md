Accepted OLS-participants are asked if they need a microgrant as part of OLS registration.

## Personal items this policy covers from acceptance into Nebula

These are items to help you participate in online calls with the cohort. For the _October - November 2024 Nebula cohort_, we are able to offer reimbursements of up to $100 USD for the following expenses:

- Mobile data top-ups.
- Broadband provider (Cable, DSL, Satellite).


## Applicant workflow

1. **Requesting a microgrant:** Accepted OLS-participants are asked if they need a microgrant as part of OLS registration. The OLS organisers will send over a short Civi form to fill out your details, including telling us _what_ you want and _how_ to reimburse you.
2. **Record your purchase:** Once you have filled out the form, you should go ahead and purchase the items yourself. OLS organisers will only contact you if there are any problems or additional questions (e.g. if there's a missing address field). 
3. **Request reimbursement**. This is another short form, where you upload your **receipt** and share your bank account/reimbursement details. **The receipt is a requirement for processing the reimbursement.** 


# FAQs

## Who can apply for a microgrant?
Microgrants are primarily for participants accepted into an OLS program to ensure they can fully participate.

## How much money can I ask for?
As of October 2024, we can reimburse up to $100 USD for Nebula participants. We acknowledge needs differ and prices for items vary around the world. We try to be fair in our support and have as many people as possible profit from our microgrant programme, so we sometimes might ask you to prioritize your requests.

## How long will the reimbursement take?
We aim to process microgrants within four weeks of receiving your request. 

## Can I request a reimbursement for small equipment?
In the current cohort, we are **only** able to offer reimbursements for mobile data top-ups and broadband servies.

## Will OLS cover transaction and conversion fees?
We try to reimburse you in the currency of your preference to avoid conversion fees. Please note, we might not be able to make transfers of certain currencies to accounts in certain countries; we will let you know if that's the case
