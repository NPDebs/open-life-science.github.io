  description: As stated in my project proposal, I would like to learn more about

    to connect with the broader research community in Canada and worldwide is through
    digital platforms, which is why it is critically important that they learn about
    such platforms. I would also like to learn more about data management tools and
    software which can be used to organize and process data. For example, as part
    of the workshops, I would like to help the researchers write data management plans
    for their own research. Finally, although this is not specifically related to
    open science, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I will be learning R
    in the next couple of months. After discussing with members of the research center,
    we decided that the workshops should involve a brief introduction to programming
    using R. I am already quite familiar with Python, and have used it extensively
    as part of my research.
