As a NASA grantee, OLS has been running the 6-week Nebula training program since early 2024. With the new USA government, we have been asked to pause our open science 101 training for the next few months, while the curriculum is reviewed. We'll let you all know when the training is available again. 

None of OLS's other open research activities have changed.
