Public speaking has been one of my strongest skills for the longest time — but like other skills, one can never truly master it, only strive to refine it. I had the privilege of working with [**David Kershaw**](https://www.davidkershaw.net/), a remarkable public speaking coach provided by the **Society of Research Software Engineering** ([SocRSE](https://society-rse.org/)), to prepare for my [Emerging Voices plenary](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/programme/emerging-voice-plenary/) at **RSECon24**.

From the very first session, it was clear: this wasn’t just about presenting slides or speaking eloquently. David’s insights elevated public speaking into a craft that intertwines connection, storytelling, and precision. Today, **I’m excited to share some of the gems I’ve learned**. Whether you’re prepping for a talk, a webinar, or even a casual presentation, these takeaways might just transform how you approach your next speaking opportunity.

# My Main Learning Points:
## 📌 Resonance and Relevance
At the core of every talk are two primary goals: to connect emotionally (resonance) and to deliver intellectually (relevance). Striking the right balance ensures you’re not just heard, but truly remembered.

Ask yourself:

**Resonance:** How does my talk appeal to the audience’s emotions?

- Speak to the **heart**. Relate to your audience on an emotional level.

**Relevance:** Is my content practical and suited to their needs?

- Speak to the **head**. Share information that’s meaningful, accurate, and on point.

Balance these two, and you’ll have your audience engaged from start to finish.

## 📌 Finding the Right Pace
Ever noticed how a pendulum swings? Left, right, left, right — it’s rhythmic but predictable. As speakers, we risk losing our audience if we’re too slow or overwhelming them if we’re too fast.

David taught me that pacing can be an art:

- **Go slow** at strategic moments to let your audience process key ideas.
- **Pick up the pace** when covering familiar or less critical details.
- **Modulate** — don’t stick to one rhythm. Alternate rhythms to keep things lively — don’t settle into a monotone “pendulum swing.”

Pro tip: Use pauses strategically. They’re like a mental exhale for your audience.

## 📌 Passion is Contagious
Enthusiasm and confidence are infectious. So, if you show genuine excitement about your topic, your audience will mirror it.

David encouraged me to imagine myself as an audience member: *How would I expect a confident speaker to act?*

Bottom line? Own the stage, and don’t be afraid to enjoy the experience.

## 📌 The Power of Rhetorical Questions
Want your audience to think deeply? Ask rhetorical questions.

A well-placed rhetorical question not only grabs attention but also invites the audience to ponder, think critically.

Bonus tip: Follow it up with a quick one-liner that subtly leads the audience toward the point you’re making.

For instance: “Wouldn’t it be great if coffee was free for a day? (*pause*) Yeah, I thought so too.”

## 📌 Storytelling: The Secret Weapon/More Than Words
Stories aren’t just for entertainment — they’re a bridge to connect with your audience on a personal level.

Personal experiences, when shared within appropriate boundaries, create a sense of familiarity and even intimacy. Using metaphors or idioms adds color and paints vivid mental pictures that keep listeners invested and engaged.

## 📌 Keep Them Guessing
David encouraged me to embrace the element of surprise. Add something unexpected to your talk — an unconventional approach, a surprising fact, or a playful twist. It keeps the audience on their toes and leaves a lasting impression.

## 📌 Emphasise new ideas.
Remember: your audience is hearing your material for the first time. Don’t gloss over fresh or complex ideas — slow down, articulate clearly, and make them count.

In short, *take your time explaining new ideas so they can fully absorb them*.

## 📌 It’s Okay to Say “I Don’t Know”
When faced with a tough question, honesty is key. Acknowledge the person for asking, repeat the question if necessary, and take a moment to process. It’s okay to admit you don’t know the answer — it builds trust and shows humility and authenticity.

Pro tip from my colleague Irene: Repeating the question back to the audience not only buys time but also makes the asker feel heard and valued.

## 📌 Lead the Slides; Don’t Let Them Lead You
Your slides are there to support *you*, not the other way around.

Speak before transitioning slides to keep the audience focused on you, not just your visuals. Advancing the slides too soon tempts them to read ahead of you.

## 💭 Final Thoughts and Acknowledgements

Working with David Kershaw was transformative, not just for my public speaking but for my overall confidence as a communicator. His approach was thoughtful, practical, and tailored.

When he showed up to our first session with my slides printed out, I knew I was in capable hands. This level of commitment and care made me feel supported and confident.

Thank you, David, for sharing your wisdom and to the Society of RSE for making this incredible coaching experience possible.

If you’re preparing for a talk or just want to sharpen your presentation skills, I hope these lessons resonate with you.
