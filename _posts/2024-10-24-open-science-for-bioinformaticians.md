The *Open Science for Bioinformaticians* workshop, held on August 15-16, 2024, successfully introduced young professionals in Nigeria to the principles of open science and their applications in bioinformatics. This two-day virtual event was designed to empower participants with practical skills for data management, ethical data sharing, and collaborative research using open science practices.

### Workshop Overview

The program aimed to address the growing need for bioinformaticians in Nigeria to embrace open science principles. It featured sessions on core open science topics, such as data handling, ethical considerations, and the use of open platforms for collaboration. Out of over 230 applicants, 48 individuals were selected, including advanced students, early-career researchers, and professionals eager to integrate open science into their work.

All workshop resources are shared on our [Zenodo collection](https://zenodo.org/communities/bioinformatics-outreach-nigeria/records) and linked to the [Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria on GitHub](https://github.com/seunolufemi123/Bioinformatics-Outreach-Nigeria).

### Key Learning Areas

Over the two days, participants engaged in sessions that covered:
- **Open Science Fundamentals**: Understanding the benefits and practical applications.
- **Data Management in Bioinformatics**: Tools and platforms for effective open data sharing.
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: Navigating data ownership and responsible sharing.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Practical demonstrations of open science platforms for teamwork.

The program included interactive activities that allowed participants to apply the concepts discussed during the sessions. Each day concluded with a lively Q&A, where attendees engaged facilitators on topics ranging from licensing issues to choosing appropriate open-access repositories. The sessions were moderated by [Seun Olufemi]({% link people.md %}#seunolufemi123) and [Emmanuel Adamolekun]({% link people.md %}#emmanuel19-ada), and featured expert practitioners as speakers and facilitators from the global open science community, including [Dr. Malvika Sharan]({% link people.md %}#malvikasharan), [Laura Ondari]({% link people.md %}#laurah-nyasita-ondari), [Pauline Karega]({% link people.md %}#karegapauline), [Michael Landi]({% link people.md %}#landimi2), [Dr. Sara El-Gebali]({% link people.md %}#selgebali), [Dr. Yo Yehudi]({% link people.md %}#yochannah), and [Deborah Udoh]({% link people.md %}#npdebs), who provided valuable insights and hands-on guidance.

### Impact and Next Steps

Feedback from participants indicated a substantial increase in confidence in applying open science principles. The workshop laid the groundwork for ongoing efforts, including:
- **Building a Community of Practice**: Creating a support network where participants can continue to share resources, collaborate on projects, and exchange ideas.
- **Follow-up Training Sessions**: Organizing advanced workshops to delve deeper into specialized open science tools and their applications.
- **Mentorship Opportunities**: Pairing participants with mentors from our global network to guide them in applying open science principles to their ongoing research.

*Our participants appreciated personalized certificates of participation.* ![This image is a Certificate of Participation from Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria. The certificate is primarily white with green accents and borders. At the top right are logos for OLS and BHKi. The title "CERTIFICATE OF PARTICIPATION" appears in bold green text in the center, followed by a placeholder text: "This certificate is proudly presented to," and a space below for a recipient's name. Further down, the sentence continues and reads "in recognition of their participation in the Open Science for Bioinformaticians Workshop, 15-16 August 2024, organized by Bioinformatics Outreach Nigeria and supported by Open Life Science (OLS) & Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Initiative (BHKi)."  Below, signatures of Seun Olufemi and Emmanuel Adamolekun are included, with their titles (co-organizers) beneath.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69c810ae-f15f-46bc-ab0b-03eb43cc67c8)
