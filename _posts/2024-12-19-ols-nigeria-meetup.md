There‚Äôs something magical about meeting people you‚Äôve worked with virtually for ages and instantly feeling like family when you finally see each other in real life. That‚Äôs exactly how it felt when **the OLS Nigeria Team met up for the first time** this past Tuesday, December 17, 2024, at the vibrant Art Tech District in **Abuja**.

Let‚Äôs set the scene: four of us, coming from different parts of the country, converging in one place. [Taj]({% link people.md %}#tajuddeen1), our Program Coordinator for the Catalyst project, flew in from Kano; [Jilaga]({% link people.md %}#jilaga), the creative force behind OLS‚Äôs branding, joined us from Lagos; [Debs]({% link people.md %}#npdebs), our Web Developer and Community Manager extraordinaire, made her way from Port Harcourt; and [Seun]({% link people.md %}#seunolufemi123), our Abuja-based Resident Fellow, welcomed us to his city.

By noon, we were all gathered, a mix of excitement and slight nervousness in the air‚Äîbut that didn‚Äôt last long. It only took a few minutes of epic banter to break the ice: Debs and Taj debated whether the Art Tech District was really just a 10-minute walk from the hotel, with Seun chiming in to say he doesn‚Äôt trust Google Maps. (Spoiler: there‚Äôs a hilarious reason Debs and Taj couldn‚Äôt agree on the distance‚Äîread on!)

Needless to say, we clicked. Big time.

We kicked off our day with an **escape room challenge**‚Äî‚Äúa team-building exercise,‚Äù we told ourselves. The mission? Solve a murder case within 30 minutes. Did we crack it? Nope. (Turns out we‚Äôre better at our jobs than catching imaginary killers.) But we uncovered bigger mysteries ‚Äì Taj is great at Chemistry, Jilaga‚Äôs an undercover detective, and Seun will seize every opportunity to taunt Debs by fumbling with the light switch.

Next stop: the **Discovery Museum**. It was a walk through Nigerian history, culture, and creativity. We soaked up every moment, from admiring the exhibits to singing along to iconic Nigerian throwback tunes.  A documentary on the effect of the "Boko Haram" insurgency had us reflecting deeply on the resilience of our nation, and feeling grateful for the gift of life. And, of course, we couldn‚Äôt resist snapping photos at every turn‚Ä¶

![A photo collage containing individual images, each telling a unique story. At the top left corner, the first picture shows two people sitting on a white bench in an art gallery: Seun, an adult black male wearing a blue t-shirt and gray jeans, and Debs, an adult black female with red hair extensions and a purple jumpsuit with white dots. At the top right corner, Seun is smiling in a photo with an adult black female, Jilaga, who has cornrows and dark shades. There are three images in the middle row of the collage: the first photo has Jilaga and Debs standing beside an adult black male, Taj, who is wearing a beige African "senator" outfit with glasses. They are in front of a large screen showing different Nigerian currencies. Next to this image, is a picture showing the evolution of Nigerian music, from 50s to 70s. The last image in the middle row contains traditional beads of the Igbos, and a screen displays palm kernels - above, a sign reads "Igbo culture." The third and final row of the collage has two images: on the left, Taj, Seun and Jilaga pose for a photo, and on the right, a table is filled with dishes like rice, salad and chow mein.]({% link images/ols-ng-meetup/ols-ng-collage.jpg %}) 

By lunchtime, the conversation flowed as freely as the food. Fun fact: there‚Äôs a short list of things Nigerians love more than good food. We shared bites of our meals, in the same way we dove into each other‚Äôs worlds. We shared laughs, swapped stories, and found common ground in our unique journeys within OLS.

We got to learn about Jilaga‚Äôs background in Architecture‚Äìmind blown! She also gave us the inside scoop on the intricate process of design and branding. 
Taj, on the other hand, spoke about his academic pursuit, which has taken him across continents, and his growing passion for Project Management and AI.
Meanwhile, Seun talked about his Bioinformatics background, his activity within the OLS and his Community‚Äôs participation in The Catalyst project. And Debs? It was a time to reflect on growth and new possibilities.

To wrap up the day on a sweet note, we made our way to a cozy spot for gelato.  It was the perfect ending to an unforgettable day‚Äîbecause what‚Äôs better than bonding over shared love for dessert?

![Photo shows four (4) separate cups containing two (2) scoops of gelato. Each cup is placed on a white serviette.]({% link images/ols-ng-meetup/ols-ng-gelato.jpeg %}){: style="max-width: 70%; max-height: 500px;"}

This meet-up wasn‚Äôt just a chance to put faces to names; it was a celebration of camaraderie. We may have started the day as colleagues, but by the end of it, we were more like a family. 

So, here‚Äôs to more in-person meetups! ü•Ç

**P.S.** Remember that epic Debs-Taj banter? Here‚Äôs the scoop: the city has two Chelsea Hotels, and the whole time, we thought we were staying at the same one. Debs only realised the mix-up when the cab dropped her and Taj off, and Taj headed up to his room‚Äîwhile Debs discovered she was at the wrong place. Luckily, Jilaga swooped in to save the day and took Debs to the right hotel. Classic misadventure, right?
