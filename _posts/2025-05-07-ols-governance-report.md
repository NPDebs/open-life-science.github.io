Since being elected in **June 2023**, the [OLS Governance Committee]({% link governance.md %}), has been quietly but actively working behind the 
scenes—providing oversight, supporting leadership decisions, and helping to steer OLS toward a stronger future.

Today, we proudly share the latest **Governance Committee Report**, which covers discussions and reflections 
from **July through December 2024**. In it, you'll find highlights of what’s been going well, where we’re still learning, 
and the steps we’re taking to make sure OLS remains transparent, inclusive, and ready for the future.

Over the past six months, the Governance has:
- Reflected on OLS’s financial stabilisation and emphasised the need for thoughtful budgeting moving forward
- Pushed for clearer leadership roles and succession planning
- Helped shape strategies for more sustainable funding and outreach
- Prioritised safe spaces, inclusivity, and strong governance processes
- Laid the groundwork for recruiting the next generation of Governance Committee members

This work underscores a crucial truth: governance at OLS is not about bureaucracy—it's about building a resilient, 
values-driven organisation where everyone can thrive.

We invite you to read the [full report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekt1AZ1IPqfvdp-833Mu72Ce0a30alzp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101989895789810384353&rtpof=true&sd=true) 
and see how collective leadership is shaping the future of OLS.
