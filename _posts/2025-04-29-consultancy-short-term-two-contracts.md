**UPDATE 2025-05-19: Application period extension**

We have extended the timeline by one additional week. Please submit applications by end of day (anywhere in the world) 26 May 2025. Expect all timelines in the information sheets to be extended by one week to compensate for the extension. 

In addition, please note that contract completion may result in further contracts if the initial consultancy was successful. 

## Original post:  

One of OLS's key organisational priorities over the next 1-2 years is creating additional organisational stability. We are inviting community members and value-aligned individuals and organisations to pitch for two short-term contracts. 

Each contract is allocated a budget of $5,000 USD. 

- Contract 1: **marketing and income diversification**. [Requirements information sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nWa1wOoyiSyGu1p3lFqw9XVitvLa6KQXH4v68tHgDG8/edit?tab=t.0).
- Contract 2: **policy consultancy**. [Requirements information sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tV8OZU7kEetqAHSemGfXPnGqFcPHQOkz4-F0jiH0Diw/edit?tab=t.0).

Both contracts are **open to applications from anywhere in the world**, although the policy consultancy requires awareness of up-to-date legal regulations in the United Kingdom, so may be more likely to be awarded to someone who is or has lived in the United Kingdom. 

Contracts may be awarded to **organisations or individuals** who meet the requirements. Applicants may apply for one or both of the contracts; they will be assessed separately. 

## Timeline: 
- Call for bids announced: 2025-04-29
- Bids due by: ~~2025-05-19~~ 2025-05-26 end of day (anywhere in the world)

For the remainder of the timeline and other details, please see the information sheets.
