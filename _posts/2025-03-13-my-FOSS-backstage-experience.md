## Day 1: Waving Through a Window
Attending [FOSS Backstage](https://25.foss-backstage.de/) online was a contrast to my past virtual conference experiences, especially compared to the highly engaging [Collaborations Workshop](https://www.software.ac.uk/workshop/collaborations-workshop-2025-cw25). 
There was no opportunity to ask speakers questions directly, no intentional networking efforts, and little to differentiate attending live from simply waiting for the recordings to be released.
While the platform itself was user-friendly and easy to navigate, the nature of the talks further contributed to my sense of disconnection. 
_Legal & Compliance, Economics, Governance_ - these topics, while critical to open source, are not my usual focus. As a result, much of the content went over my head. 
To make matters worse, scheduling conflicts meant I missed some talks I had been looking forward to.

## Day 2: Finding my Tribe!
Despite the continued lack of online engagement, the quality of talks on Day 2 completely made up for my initial disappointment. 
The sessions were rich, insightful, and deeply resonant.

### Anatomy of an Open Internship Program: How We Run Outreachy - Anna e só
Every time I hear Anna speak, compassion absolutely shines through. Outreachy has run for 15+ years, overcoming numerous challenges, and Anna's words help me see into the heart that has sustained it.
A key discussion point was why some organisations continue to return as Outreachy partners. Anna explained that many long-standing partners recognise their privilege and use it to bring others into FOSS. Past interns also return as mentors, giving back to the community that helped them grow.

_"I want them [Outreachy interns] to succeed even more than I have…"_ - these words will keep resounding for a long time.

The session was further enriched by the moderator in the bUm Box room, who shared how being an Outreachy mentor had deeply enriched his experience as a developer.

### Bridging the Gap Between Designers & Open Source Communities - Nina Rojc, Leia Ruffini, and Kola Ojoodide
This talk addressed several long-standing questions I've had, such as:
- Why aren't there more open source designers?
- If they exist, why aren't they more visible?
- What prevents designers from contributing to Open Source?
- How can we balance creative expression with design guidelines?

The speakers emphasised the role of clear contribution guidelines and diplomacy in managing diverse ideas within open source projects. A structured process helps create space for creativity while maintaining coherence.

(Side note: Kola has a very soothing voice!)

### Tokenism in Open Source: Diversity or Decoration? - Maryblessing Okolie & Ijeoma Onwuka
Ijeoma flew 17 hours from Nigeria to Berlin to deliver her first international talk - while also professing her love for K-dramas! 
Meanwhile, Maryblessing joined virtually. Their discussion on tokenism in open source hit close to home, especially since I personally experienced it this week (more on that in another post, perhaps).

![A black woman wearing a two-piece outfit made from traditional African prints, presents a talk, with slides displayed on the right. The words on the current slide are "please do not do DEl out of pity or checking a box. think of DEl as giving opportunities to groups of people with great abilities that would otherwise not have access to that opportunity."](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5470ee2-9d9b-4d09-b3c4-f851c332dc2d){: style="max-width: 80%; max-height: 600px;" }

They challenged organisations to move beyond merely showcasing diversity in marketing materials and instead **create genuine pathways to leadership for marginalised individuals**. 
Their call to action? **Design for everyone, enforce Codes of Conduct, improve accessibility, and build inclusive practices**. 
This resonated deeply, especially as I am currently conducting an accessibility review for my organisation's [website]({{ site.url }}).

### Right-to-Left, Left-to-Right: Rethinking Multilingual Design - Batool Almarzouq, Goodnews Sunday Sandy and Richie Moluno
Many software systems fail to support Right-to-Left (RTL) languages like Arabic, creating barriers for millions of users. 
The speakers shared their experiences designing "**Open Science MOOCs**" - a multilingual platform with videos, quizzes, and RTL-friendly design.
The discussion highlighted key UX challenges, such as how navigation arrows, horizontal progress bars, and even emojis can be misinterpreted by RTL users. 
The takeaway? Designing for inclusivity means considering diverse reading directions and user habits from the start.

### Empowering African Communities Using Open Source - Joseph Zikusooka
Joseph highlighted areas where FOSS can drive impact in Africa: health, research, education, agriculture, tourism, startups, and environmental initiatives. 
He also pointed out the challenges Africans face in getting into open source, such as high internet costs, poor connectivity, and frequent power cuts. 
The keys to empowering African communities include support, engagement, partnerships, certification, and incubation.

### Open Design Guide - Christoph Ono & Eriol Fox
[The Open Design Guide](https://opendesign.guide) is **12 chapters** of wisdom, and serves as a **bridge for designers entering open source**.

One thing that stood out for me was how they acknowledged the role of GenAI in the guide's development, while admitting its limitations. 
I particularly loved the idea of a reading club and plan to borrow this for my [Research 101 course](https://npdebs.github.io/Pre-seeds-Program/)!

### Beyond Words: Crafting User-Friendly Documentation - Zainab Daodu
This was a fantastic, practical talk on documentation, born out of a wealth of experience! Some key lessons (in bullet points, to make Zainab proud):

- Structure content logically to enhance usability.
- Use clear, concise and **simple** language to simplify technical details.
- Incorporate visuals - diagrams, flowcharts, screenshots - to aid understanding.
- Establish feedback loops for continuous documentation improvement (i.e. incorporate frequently asked questions into the docs).

### Relationship Problems in Open Source - Shauna Gordon-McKeon
Shauna identified some challenges in FOSS - burnout, onboarding difficulties, funding issues, and bad User Experience. The solution? Strong relationships.

**When we build personal connections, contributors and users stop being abstract figures and become real people we care about.** 
The 5'Cs in relationship-building: **Clarify, Connect, Communicate, Conflict, Commit**.

## Honestly…
…the highlight of my FOSS Backstage experience was **seeing my sisters shine**! I hope to see even more underrepresented voices given platforms to speak in the future.

I'm eagerly looking forward to the recordings being released at the end of the week so I can catch:
- _More Hearts than Stars: Smart Charging & Community Funding - Michael Geers_
- _OSPOs for Good! Achieving the UN SDGs with Open Source - Panel Discussion_
- _Abundant with Life: Docs Beyond the Wall - Andrea Kao_
- _Commit to Inclusion: Building Better Open Source Culture - Ashley Sametz_
- _Building Open Digital Infrastructures for Public Health - Bianca Kastl_

Despite the slow start, FOSS Backstage 2025 ended on a high note. What I would do differently next time is be there in-person next time!
